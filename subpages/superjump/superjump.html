      <h3>Horizontal Zipline Superjump</h3>
      <p>
      A zipline superjump or superjump for short occurs when you compound your basic jump and zipline dismount jump, this is most easily done by scroll jumping and pressing INTERACT at the same time, but note that this can also be done without scroll jump by simply spamming JUMP. If done correctly you will be catapulted in the
      direction you travel when you dismount with a jump and upwards, for horizontal ziplines, the dismount direction is already upwards so you'll be catapulted straight upwards.
<br class="big">
      Note that you can airstrafe after you superjump to get atop a ledge or a somewhere where you couldn't typically climb to.
      <br class="big">
      Due to the fact that a superjump compounds both a standard jump and a dismount you lurch is charged coming out of all superjumps.

      <h3>Vertical Zipline Superjumps</h3>
      <p>
A vertical zipline jump follows the same principle of the horizontal and, and is performed in the same way. The only difference is that your dismount direction is forwards so you are catapulted forwards and upwards. <br class="big"> Note that this forward momentum can be counteracted by holding BACKWARDS as you superjump, this will result in a superjump with close to zero horizontal momentum. I've found that this is useful for navigating zip buildings.

      <h3>Superjumping With Spacebar</h3>
      <p>
        As I previously stated, a superjump compounds the zipline dismount jump with your standard jump to give you extra height. When you superjump with scroll these jumps occur at practically the same time, but when superjumping with an actual key, there is a noticeable delay between jumps.
        Thereby for a breif period between when you leave the ground and when your second jump kicks in, you will not be charged with lurch, meaning you can't tapstrafe. But it also means that time you have to tapstrafe is extended because your second jump, which does charge you with lurch is delayed.
        Note that this delay in itself can also be abused, ex. initiating a superjump in an area with a low ceiling, and not having your second jump kick in until you wouldn't hit your head. I show this in the second and third clip.      </p>
