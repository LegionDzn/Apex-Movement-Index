        <p class="slightlydarker">Before you can learn to fatigue wall bounce, you first must understand the concept of jump fatigue. Jump fatigue is a state in which your character can be in, to enter this state you must JUMP, slide jump, or wall
          jump. Once you touch the ground, a 900ms timer will be started, when it expires you will no longer jump fatigued, touching the ground after jumping resets this timer. When you are jump fatigued, your jump height will be reduced, and you'll
          be able to wall jump without sliding, this is called a fatigue wall jump.
          <br><br>
          As is often the case, you'll be jumping with the hopes to land right in front of the wall, then jumping into the wall to fatigue wall jump. Because of this, you often have to manually start climbing the wall to fatigue wall jump, as your
          velocity isn't sufficient when coming out a jump, this can be done by being next to the wall, then quickly tap a directional input in the direction the wall is in, this doesn't work with BACKWARD. Once you're attached to the wall, simply
          jump to wall jump. I recommend using scroll jump instead of using spacebar.
          <br><br>
          To do a basic fatigue wall jump, JUMP, hit the ground, then jump towards the wall, while in the air tap w to attach to the wall, and JUMP once attached.

      <p class="heading2">Using LEFT and RIGHT</p>
      <div class="c_container_inner">
        <div class="video_container"><video src="iwb.mp4" onmouseover="this.play()" controls loop muted></div>
        <p class="slightlydarker">Fatigue wall jumping by attaching to the wall with FORWARD has a set trajectory, resulting in tapstrafing being necessary to make it practical. (eg. not being able to infinite wall jump against a flat wall) This issue can be fixed by holding a or d while you wall jump, you can attach by tapping FORWARD, then holding LEFT or RIGHT as you fatigue wall jump, or by purely holding either LEFT or RIGHT for the duration of the fatigue wall jump. Note that if you do use this strafe keys only method, you must look away from the wall so that your LEFT or RIGHT direction is directly facing the wall, as seen in the video.
          <br><br>
          Doing this extends your range of motion, and exit velocity quite a bit. This combined with the mantle-proof nature of using exclusively LEFT or RIGHT creates a compelling argument to only use strafe keys when attaching to walls.

        <div class="video_container"><video src="mpwb.mp4" onmouseover="this.play()" controls loop muted></div>
        <p class="slightlydarker">This holding of LEFT or RIGHT is necessary when attempting to Fatigue wall jump off surfaces which we auto-mantle onto. To prevent this auto mantle behavior, you hold LEFT or RIGHT depending on the direction you're going, this will make you unable to mantle, thereby allowing you to Fatigue wall jump. If you end up manteling the wall, you're likely inputting LEFT or RIGHT too late.

          <p class="slightlydarker">Successfully executing a Fatigue wall jump will charge your lurch, this makes Fatigue wall jumps play very well with tapstrafing. When tapstrafing and wall jumping there are a couple of things that you want to keep in mind.
            <br>
            <br>

            For maximum momentum preservation, you wanna hit the wall at a near parallel angle. Although the directional change to achieve this is often done through camera movement + tapstrafing, I also find it useful to use LEFT or RIGHT tapstrafing
            or BACKWARD + LEFT or RIGHT tapstrafing for even finer control.
            <br>
            <br>
            If you have to make a sharp tapstrafe out of a Fatigue wall jump, you may want to begin your tapstrafe in the direction you're traveling then move your camera to the direction you want to go. This near essential for Fatigue wall jumps due to the low amount of momentum they give you.

      <p class="heading2">Fatigue Wallrun Jump</p>
      <div class="c_container_inner">
        <div class="video_container"><video src="fwr.mp4" onmouseover="this.play()" controls loop muted></div>
        <p class="slightlydarker">Similar to slide jump wall jumps, fatigue wall jumps allow you to wallrun, by holding LEFT or RIGHT once you're attached to the wall. Compared to slide jump wall runs, you're at a much lower velocity, allowing you to change your direction upon hitting the wall by holding. This can be seen in the second and third clips.</p>
