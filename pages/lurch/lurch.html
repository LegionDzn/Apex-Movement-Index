        <p class="slightlydarker"> Strafe lurch or lurch is something that has been hardcoded into the game even since Titanfall 2. Lurch occurs when you input a directional input within a 500ms or half-second window after jumping, double jumping, wall jumping, or supergliding.
          For this period your lurch is "Charged" when you input a directional input your character lurches in that direction. Note that for the first 200ms of this 500ms window your lurch is significantly more powerful, and after this 200ms period
          your lurch strength will deteriorate over the remaining 300ms. <br><br> Lurch allows you to make quick, small corrections of your mid-air trajectory by just hitting the direction you wanna go in directly after jumping. <br><br> If a
          directional input is held during another lurch, you still lurch, just in the directional compromise between the two inputs. This is why tapstrafing while holding the directional input in which you are turning results in a shaper turn. It
          also follows that BACKWARD + FORWARDS and LEFT + RIGHT cancel eachother out. <br><br> Mastering lurch is the first step to gaining full control of your micro-movements in-game. As long as you can jump, you can lurch. Lurch is fundamental in
          tapstrafing, and all other forms of redirecting. </p>

      <p class="heading2">Lurch Stacking</p>
      <div class="c_container_inner">
        <div class="video_container"><video src="lurchstack.mp4" onmouseover="this.play()" controls loop muted></div>
        <p class="slightlydarker">These lurches can be stacked with one being added per directional input, allowing for some extremely fine control of your character. I found that this is often one of the big skill gaps when it comes to in-fight
          movement. To stack lurches you simply spam the direction in which you want to shift your momentum in. Speed is key when stacking lurches, as it's often difficult to stack enough inputs before your lurch becomes uncharged. Input wise, 3 or 4
          lurches are required to make a sharp 90-degree similar to the ones demonstrated in the video. <br><br> This is technically tapstrafing, but let's not call it that to differentiate it from scroll tapstrafing, which is alot more potient than
          lurch stacking with keyboard inputs. <br><br> *TAP*TAP*TAP*TAP*TAP*TAP*TAP* <br><br> Now that you know what principal is at play, you can deduce why we bind FORWARD to a scroll bind.</p>
