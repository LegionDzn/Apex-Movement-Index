    A superglide can be performed by mantling onto a surface, then while mantling holding a direction key (or two such as FORWARD + LEFT) except BACKWARD and inputting a DUCK and JUMP at the same time at the apex of a mantel animation. This, if
    performed correctly, will result
    in your character accelerating to 550 velocity nearly instantaneously in the direction of the previously held directional input. The timing for supergliding has a very tight, 1-3 frame window near the apex of the mantle animation, so 50ms at
    60fps or 20.7ms at 144fps. DUCK must be inputted one frame before JUMP and must both be inputted within this window to successfully execute a superglide.
    <br>
    In this video I demonstrate supergliding with a JUMP being a keyboard bind, to aid in inputting a DUCK and JUMP withing the window, it's recommended that you bind either C, V, or B to crouch allowing you to press DUCK and JUMP with one motion
    of the thumb.
    <br>
    If you have difficulty supergliding or want to superglide with more consistency, I recommend using a program called RTSS to cap your framerate. I and others have noted that it's measurably easier to superglide with this program capping your fps. For more information, check out (Optimizing for Latency)

<p class="slightlydarker">        In this video, I demonstrate Supergliding with a scroll jump + DUCK. I found this method to be more consistent prior to me installing clicky switches in my keyboard (had MX reds before), at which point I retired this method and switched over to the keyboard method.

<br>
The list is in order in which I perform them in the video.
<br>
<br>

  • (A+S+D) LEFT + BACKWARD + RIGHT (Psudo BACKWARD superglide, BACKWARD and RIGHT must be inputted slightly after the superglide. Note that this utilize lurch.)
  <br>  <br>

  • (A) LEFT
  <br>  <br>

  • (A+W) LEFT + FORWARDS
  <br>  <br>

  • (W) FORWARDS
  <br>  <br>

  • (D+W) RIGHT + FORWARDS
  <br>  <br>

  • (D) RIGHT
  <br>  <br>

  • (D+S+A) RIGHT + BACKWARD + LEFT (Psudo BACKWARD superglide, BACKWARD and LEFT must be inputted slightly after the superglide. Note that this utilize lurch.)
