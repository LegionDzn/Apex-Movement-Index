        <p class="slightlydarker">      A Redirect is a type of momentum shift that allows you to sharply turn up to 90 degrees. Although redirecting is a type of momentum shift, it's called a redirect due to the fact that it was dubbed that by Aceu in his movement guide. Redirecting has many applications but is outclassed in many ways by tapstrafing due to its greater versatility and arguably easier to execute.
        <br><br>
        A Redirect can be performed by being in the air with some momentum (usually by slide jumping) then after facing your back towards the direction you want to go, pressing the A+S+D or D+S+A, this depends on the direction you are turning. If you're turning left you press A+S+D and if you're turning right, you press D+S+A.
        <br><br>
        The global rule is to turn your back towards the direction you want to go,
        press the key in the direction you are traveling (a), then the key in the direction you want to turn (s), then the key opposite of your original direction (D)
