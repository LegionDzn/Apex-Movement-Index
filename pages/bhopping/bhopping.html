        <p class="slightlydarker">B-Hopping is something we can use to preserve our current momentum for short distances. A b-hop can be performed inputting JUMP as soon as you hit the ground, this is typically done by scroll jumping but can also be
          done with key input, albeit with much tighter timing. Note that as we continue to b-hop, we slowly lose momentum, this occurs because when you are touching the ground, even for a short time like in this case, you lose momentum. </p>

        <p class="slightlydarker">We can add an airstafe to our B-hop to accelerate, thereby negating the gradual loss of momentum allowing ourselves to b-hop indefinitely. This is good for healing when you need to be moving. Due to the fact that you
          get less speed from airstrafing the faster you are going and that it's slower than sprinting the practicle uses are limited. <br><br>Note that inputting a directional inputting without air strafing in that direction will cause you to lose
          speed, so don't hold FORWARD when b-hopping, it'll do nothing but slow you down. </p>

        <p class="slightlydarker">When airstafe b-hop healing, my testing has found that the velocity ranges between 160 and 235. Although this velocity isn't always in the perfectly forward direction, it is much better than the standard 104 velocity
          we typically get when healing. </p>
