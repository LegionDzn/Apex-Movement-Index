        <p class="slightlydarker">Tapstrafing is a method of lurch stacking in which you use scroll wheel binds instead of keyboard binds to enter directional inputs to stack lurches. Tapstrafing is often bound to FORWARD, but can also be bound to
          any directional input. A Tapstrafe can be performed by inputing many directional inputs within 500ms after you jump or double jump, most always via scroll binds. <br><br> Knowledge of lurch is essential to get the most out of tapstrafing. If you want to know more about check out my page
          on <a href="..\Lurch\Lurch.html">Lurch</a><br><br>If a directional input is held during another lurch, you still lurch,
          just in the directional compromise between the two directions. This is why tapstrafing while holding the directional input in which you are turning results in a shaper turn. <br><br> Tapstrafing works by abusing lurch thereby must be
          performed when your lurch is charged (aka 1/2 seconds after a jump). By stacking these lurches by spam inputting FORWARD, we can allow ourselves to turn extremely sharply. </p>

        <p class="slightlydarker"> Due to the nature of Lurch, If a directional input is held during a tapstrafe, you still lurch, just in the directional compromise between the two inputs. This is why tapstrafing while holding the directional input
          in which you are turning results in a shaper turn. <br><br>Since there are no disadvantages of Multi-input Tapstrafing, you often end up using it more than standard tapstrafing. But are cases where standard tapstrafing is necessary.</p>

        <p class="slightlydarker">For this video exclusively I've bound BACKWARD to scroll down. <br><br>
          As I mentioned previously you can tapstrafe with any directional input so backward tapstrafing is possible, as is left and right tapstrafing.<br><br>Before the first tapstrafe in this clip I redirect left by lurch stacking before backward tapstrafing, this is because if I were to tapstrafe without redirecting, all my forward momentum would be canceled out. By shifting my momentum left, I have very little forward momentum to cancel out, and more leftwards momentum which I can redirect into backward momentum with my tapstrafe. </p>
