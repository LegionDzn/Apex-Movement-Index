        <p class="slightlydarker">Tapstrafing is a method of lurch stacking in which you use scroll wheel binds instead of keyboard binds to enter directional inputs to stack lurches. Tapstrafing is often bound to FORWARD, but can also be bound to
          any directional input. A Tapstrafe can be performed by inputing a directional input most always via scroll binds.

          <br><br>
          Knowledge of lurch is essential to get the most out of tapstrafing. If you want to know more about check out my page on <a href="..\Lurch\Lurch.html">Lurch</a>


<br><br>
you can also hold LEFT or RIGHT when tapstrafing with FORWARD or BACKWARD to turn sharper in that diection.
          <br><br>

If a directional input is held during another lurch, you still lurch, just in the directional compromise between the two directions. This is why tapstrafing while holding the directional input in which you are turning results in a shaper turn.           <br><br>

          Tapstrafing works by abusing lurch thereby must be performed when your lurch is charged (aka 1/2 seconds after a jump). By stacking these lurches by spam inputting FORWARD, we can allow ourselves to turn extremely sharply.

        <p class="slightlydarker">          Due to the nature of Lurch, If a directional input is held during a tapstrafe, you still lurch, just in the directional compromise between the two inputs. This is why tapstrafing while holding the directional input in which you are turning results in a shaper turn.
