        <p class="slightlydarker">A slide jump is the most fundamental movement tech which exists in apex legends and is the most basic way to increase your speed. A slide jump can be performed by simply sliding, then jumping. As a general rule, the most effective slide jumps occur when you slide for 150 to 200ms, then input a jump. A maximum momentum slide can be executed after 150ms of sprinting from a holstered standstill.  It's also one of the best ways to initiate a tapstrafe seeing how you can quickly and easily put yourself mid-air, where tapstrafing is most effective.</p>

        <p class="slightlydarker">A Quick Slide is at its core a basic slide, but by using some tricks we can move a shorter distance before we can execute a full momentum slide. To recap a full momentum slide takes 150ms of holstered sprinting to execute, this is no different with a quick slide, except we start our sprinting in a crouching state so we move slower while still technically holstered sprinting, so the inputs go as follows:
        Be in a crouching state and start sprinting wait at least 30ms, then release DUCK, standing up takes 120ms, so by the time you fully stand up, you can input a DUCK to initiate a slide, all while moving less physical distance to the slide. If you want to follow this up with a jump 150ms to 200ms after you start sliding you can turn this into a quick slide jump, which is what I do in the video.</p>
